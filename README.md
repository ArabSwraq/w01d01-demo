## W01D02 Demo

This is a repository for our demo on how to use git.

To make a repository we write a command:

`git init`
`git init`
`git init`
Then we add our files, and change those files.
Once we are satisified, we run the command `git add _____ `
to stage the files, and then `git commit -m ______` to commit them.

### Git Workflow

- Commit Often
- `git add _file_names`
- `git commit -m _commit_message_`
